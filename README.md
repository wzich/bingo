# Bingo

This is a simple bingo game written in React and TypeScript on a Deno server
with Vite.

## Gameplay

A random 4x4 grid of animal emoji is generated when the page is loaded. Click on
a tile to fill it in. When you've got bingo, you'll be alerted.

## Running

You need to have Deno v2.0.0 or later installed to run this repo.

Start a dev server:

```
$ deno task dev
```
